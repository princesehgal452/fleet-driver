    2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES<br />
    3. FLEETROVER INC. provides a platform via the Mobile App and our Website (defined above as the “Services”) so
    that Shippers may submit Shipments through the Service.<br />
    4. Once FLEETROVER INC. accepts a Shipment for posting, the Shipment’s details, as provided by the Shipper,
    will be posted to the Service. The Shipper may cancel a Shipment at any time prior to a Carrier accepting it.
    You may view a list of Shipments available to you at any time and accept a Shipment through the Service. Once
    you accept a Shipment, you will be assigned to perform transportation services related to the Shipment.<br />
    5. FLEETROVER INC. will notify the Shipper that the Shipment has been accepted. It also will notify you that
    the Shipment has been assigned to you; PROVIDED, however, that FLEETROVER INC. does not guarantee that your
    attempt to accept any Shipment will be successful. FLEETROVER INC. assigns Shipments to the first Carrier
    which accepts the posting. If the original Carrier assignment fails for whatever reason, the Shipment will be
    re-posted to the Service.<br />
    6. Within a reasonable time after accepting tender of cargo for transport, you shall upload to the Service
    your bill of lading for the shipment. You shall not name FLEETROVER INC. as either a shipper or consignee on

    hereunder include the transportation of the cargo from origin to destination; the cost of any fuel, tolls,
    ferry charges or other expenses related to the operation or maintenance of your equipment; and any other
    specialized services or equipment contemplated in the load tender (including, but not limited to amounts for
    refrigerated trailers, lift-gate service, loading or unloading, etc.). If any additional services not
    contemplated at the time a Shipment is posted are provided by Carrier. Carrier will use its best efforts to
    provide FLEETROVER INC. advance notice of any and all unspecified ancillary services or costs incurred so that
    FLEETROVER INC. may attempt to obtain Shipper approval of such charges. Absent express prior agreement,
    FLEETROVER INC. does not guarantee that invoices for accessorial and/or ancillary services will be paid.<br />

    express written consent of FLEETROVER INC. and the Shipper. If Carrier breaches this provision, without
    limiting any other right of FLEETROVER INC. or the Shipper, Carrier shall remain fully liable pursuant to this
    Agreement as if it had transported the Shipment on vehicles operating under its for hire motor carrier
    authority (including liability for cargo loss and damage claims and including the duty to defend, indemnify

    otherwise subject to an out of service order or otherwise prohibited from providing service in accordance with
    all applicable laws, rules and regulations. In the event you are issued a safety rating of less than
    “Satisfactory” at any time during the term of this Agreement, you shall notify FLEETROVER INC. immediately in
    the manner prescribed in the Notices provision contained hereinbelow. FLEETROVER INC. shall have the right to
    terminate this Agreement immediately should Carrier fail to comply with these obligations.”<br />

    obtained through the Service as a for-hire motor carrier in accordance with any and all applicable laws, rules
    and regulations. You represent and warrant that you are licensed by FMCSA as a for-hire motor carrier of
    property in interstate commerce pursuant to 49 USC §13902. With respect to the transportation services
    provided under this Agreement, including any drivers you use, you shall comply with all applicable federal,
    state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. You shall defend, indemnify and hold FLEETROVER INC.

    regulations applicable to: transportation of Hazardous Materials (including the licensing and training of

    14. You warrant that you shall perform all transportation services pursuant to this Agreement with equipment
    that is regularly maintained and is in good order, condition and repair and that meets with all applicable
    federal and state laws, rules and regulations. You will not supply equipment that has been used to transport
    hazardous wastes of any kind, including, solid, liquid, or hazardous, regardless of whether they meet the
    definition in 40 C.F.R. §261.1 et. seq. You will furnish equipment for transporting cargo which is clean, dry,
    leak proof, free from harmful or offensive odor, sanitary, and free of any contamination, suitable for the
    particular commodity being transported and which will not cause in whole or in part adulteration of the
    commodity as defined in 21 U.S.C § 342.<br />
    15. Unless a trailer is pre-loaded and sealed prior to Carrier’s arrival at destination, and the applicable
    bill of lading bears a “shipper load and count”, “SLC” or similar designation, Carrier is solely responsible
    for ensure that all equipment has been properly loaded, secured, blocked and braced. You acknowledge that

    Service, and that FLEETROVER INC. will not be responsible or have any role in the securement of cargo for
    transportation.<br />
    16. Non-Solicitation<br />
    17. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year from its termination, you shall
    neither initiate nor accept any direct or indirect business relationship with any Shipper where Shipments to
    or from such Shipper were first transported pursuant to the Service, or in connection with use of the Service.
    Your obligation in this regard extends to instances where a Shipper contacts you and seeks to establish a
    business relationship that does not include FLEETROVER INC. This provision shall continue in force beyond
    termination of this Agreement for one (1) year subsequent to termination.<br />
    18. If you book or otherwise makes available any direct or indirect business relationship with any Shipper
    that was first introduced to you by FLEETROVER INC. in violation of this Agreement, you shall be jointly and
    severally liable with the Shipper to FLEETROVER INC. for each such violation in an amount equal to twenty
    percent (20%) of all revenues paid by the Shipper to you.<br />
    19. Carrier Liability for Cargo Loss or Damage<br />
    ● Carrier’s liability for lost, destroyed, damaged or delayed Shipments is governed by 49 USC §14706 (referred
    to as “the Carmack Amendment”) regardless of whether such standard would apply in the absence of this
    Agreement. Such liability shall include, but not be limited to, amounts required to inspect, test, segregate
    and process claims. In addition to any such liability, if Shipper assesses charges against FLEETROVER INC.
    with respect to late deliveries by Carrier, Carrier shall be responsible for such amounts regardless of
    whether these is loss, damage or destruction to the Shipment in question.<br />
    ● FLEETROVER INC. may assist Shippers with claims against Carriers for lost, damaged, delayed or destroyed
    cargo and Carrier acknowledges and agrees that FLEETROVER INC. may likewise file such claims directly as the
    assignee of the Shipper. Shipper and FLEETROVER INC. shall have twelve (12) months from the date of delivery
    of any Shipment (or, if no delivery, then not less than twelve (12) months from the date on which delivery
    should have occurred) during which to file claims. Shipper and FLEETROVER INC. shall have not less than two
    (2) years from the date of denial of all or any part of any such claim during which to initiate a legal
    proceeding with respect to such claim. Carrier will pay, deny or offer to settle any claim hereunder within
    thirty (30) days of submission. Otherwise, 49 C.F.R. Part 370 will govern processing of claims.<br />
    ● Shipper shall have sole discretion as to whether to allow salvage of any damaged Shipment. If no salvage is
    allowed, Carrier shall not be entitled to a credit for salvage value. Any expenses incurred in preparation of
    goods for salvage shall be borne by Carrier.<br />
    ● Carrier will abide by any cargo handling instructions communicated to Carrier by FLEETROVER INC. or the
    Shipper, including any regarding provision of temperature controlled service. If cargo is tendered and a
    reasonable person would understand such cargo to require controlled temperature service, and no such service
    has been requested, Carrier shall contact FLEETROVER INC. immediately and in any event, prior to loading any
    such cargo onto Carrier’s conveyance. Without limiting the foregoing, if Carrier is providing service with
    respect to commodities requiring temperature control, Carrier shall ensure that its equipment is pre-cooled to
    required temperature ranges prior to or at the time of loading, and shall ensure that temperature is
    maintained at all times within specified temperature ranges. Carrier shall maintain the ability to provide a
    downloadable report of temperature during transit, and will retain such records for no less than two (2) years
    from the date of delivery, which records will be made available to FLEETROVER INC. or Shipper upon request.
    Carrier acknowledges and agrees that failure to abide by instructions regarding handling of food or evidence
    of possible unauthorized access to shipments may result in rejection of shipments due to possible adulteration
    or contamination.<br />
    ● Any attempt to limit your liability for lost, destroyed, damaged or delayed Shipments, including, but not
    limited to, via provisions contained in any bill of lading, delivery receipt or tariff shall be deemed null
    and void. Exclusions in your insurance coverage shall not exonerate you from this liability.<br />

    20. Shipping Documents<br />
    21. You shall not insert “FLEETROVER INC.” or “FLEETROVER INC., Inc.” on any receipt, bill of lading,
    manifest, or other shipping document. In the event you do so, such insertion shall be deemed to be for your
    convenience, or due to your oversight, and shall not operate to alter FLEETROVER INC.’s status as a Broker, or
    the Carrier’s status as the responsible Carrier. The provisions set forth in any shipping document maintained
    by Carrier (including, but not limited to, any bill of lading, proof of delivery, motor carrier tariff, rate
    confirmation sheet or other documentation) shall not apply to any transportation performed pursuant to
    Compliance with Instructions<br />
    22. Compliance with Instructions<br />
    23. Carrier shall comply with any and all instructions regarding the handling of the Shipment which are
    communicated to Carrier by Shipper or FLEETROVER INC., whether pursuant to the Service, on the applicable bill
    of lading, or via other load tender documentation provided to the Carrier. In addition, Carrier shall, and
    shall cause its drivers, to comply with facility rules in effect at any locations where Carrier is performing
    pick-up or delivery services.<br />
    24. You understand and agree that FLEETROVER INC., from time to time, enters into master transportation
    contracts or like documents with certain shippers. Such contracts often provide that their terms preempt and
    govern over any term within a bill of lading or other shipping document that conflicts or is otherwise
    inconsistent with the contracts. To the extent any transport you undertake hereunder is governed by a contract
    between FLEETROVER INC. and a shipper containing such a clause, you agree that any bill of lading or other
    document you issue shall be subordinate to and preempted by such contract’s terms. FLEETROVER INC. will advise
    you on request as to whether any such master transportation contract or like document containing a preemptive
    clause exists with respect to specific shipments you undertake. You further understand and agree that such
    contracts or like documents may contain terms restricting the extent to which you may be entitled to collected
    charges for accessorial and ancillary services, in which event FLEETROVER INC. will not pay related charges
    notwithstanding any advance notice.<br />
    25. Indemnity<br />
    26. CARRIER SHALL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD FLEETROVER INC., THE SHIPPER, AND EACH OF THEIR AFFILIATED
    ENTITIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST, AND SHALL PAY AND REIMBURSE, ANY AND ALL ALL DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSS,
    LIABILITY, DAMAGE, CLAIM, FINE, COST OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN

    INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CLAIMS”), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS FOR OR RELATED TO
    PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), PROPERTY DAMAGE AND CARRIER’S POSSESSION, USE, MAINTENANCE, CUSTODY OR
    OPERATION OF THE EQUIPMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT CARRIER’S INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS OBLIGATIONS
    UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH WILL NOT APPLY TO THE PRORATED EXTENT THAT ANY CLAIM IS DIRECTLY AND PROXIMATELY CAUSED
    BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF THE PARTY TO BE DEFENDED, INDEMNIFIED OR HELD HARMLESS. CARRIER
    HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY EXCLUSIVE REMEDY DEFENSE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE AVAILABLE UNDER ANY
    WORKERS’ COMPENSATION OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT STATUTORY REGIME, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE
    CARRIER’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PROVISION.<br />
    27. Additional Obligations<br />
    28. Carrier will provide exclusive use of equipment being used to handle any Shipment and will not allow the
    cargo of any third party to be transported on Carriers equipment while such equipment is being used to haul
    any Shipment under this Agreement. At no time will Carrier allow any trailing equipment being used to
    transport any Shipment become unattached from the power unit being used to transport such cargo.<br />

    13. FLEETROVER INC. provides a means for Shippers and Carriers to rate and review each other and to have those
    ratings made available to other Users. We do not express any opinion, nor does FLEETROVER INC. make any
    assurances regarding, the truth or accuracy of any User reviews or ratings. FLEETROVER INC. does not regularly
    monitor or remove reviews or ratings, or any portion thereof, unless they contain Content we deem
    inappropriate in our sole discretion.<br />
    14. PAYMENT TERMS<br />
    1. Rates and Payment<br />
    2. For each Shipment, Shipper will pay FLEETROVER INC. the freight charge quoted to the Shipper upon
    acceptance of the applicable Shipment on the Service (“Carrier Fee”), as well as additional amounts, if any,
    paid by the Shipper for additional services provided by Carrier with respect to a Shipment.<br />
    3. General Payment Terms<br />
    4. You agree that you are responsible for the collection and/or payment of all taxes, which you may be liable
    for in any jurisdiction arising from your use of the Service. FLEETROVER INC. is not responsible for
    collecting, reporting, paying, or remitting to you any such taxes.<br />
    5. FLEETROVER INC. shall pay freight charges quoted to you on the Service regardless of whether Shippers pay
    FLEETROVER INC. In exchange for this guarantee of payment, you shall not invoice or otherwise attempt to
    collect any amounts related to services provided with respect to any Shipment from any Shipper or any other
    third party; Carrier shall look solely to FLEETROVER INC. for payment of freight charges hereunder. You hereby
    waive any right you may otherwise have to proceed or commence any action against any Shipper for the
    collection of any freight bills arising out of transportation services hereunder. Furthermore, Carrier waives
    any and all lien rights with respect to any Shipment and if any lien is claimed with respect to any such
    Shipment by Carrier or a third party to which Carrier tenders such Shipment, Carrier shall immediately take
    such action as is necessary to satisfy such lien.<br />
    6. Service Incentive Payment<br />
    7. FLEETROVER INC. may, in its sole discretion, offer to Carrier a Service Incentive Payment (“SIP”). The SIP,
    if any, will be quoted separately from the Carrier Fee. To qualify for the SIP: (i), Carrier must be in
    compliance with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations at all times while performing services
    (including compliance with speed limits and hours of service regulations); (ii) Carrier must deliver the cargo
    at the appointed time; (iii) Carrier must provide a proof of delivery to FLEETROVER INC. within twenty-four
    hours of delivery which indicates that the cargo was delivered without shortage, loss or damage; and (iv)
    prior to payment, FLEETROVER INC. must not have received any complaint or claim from the Shipper or receiver
    regarding Carrier’s services with respect to the load in question. If FLEETROVER INC. pays the SIP to Carrier,
    but later learns that the Carrier failed to abide by applicable law in performance of the services to which
    the SIP related, or if FLEETROVER INC. subsequently receives a claim or complaint from the Shipper or receiver
    related to the services to which the SIP related, Carrier will refund the SIP upon demand. FLEETROVER INC. may
    offset the amount of such SIP against any funds due and owing to FLEETROVER INC.<br />
    8. Payment Facilitation and Processing<br />
